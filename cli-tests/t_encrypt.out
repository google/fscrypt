# Try to encrypt a nonempty directory
[ERROR] fscrypt encrypt: Directory "MNT/dir" cannot be
                         encrypted because it is non-empty.

Files cannot be encrypted in-place. Instead, encrypt a new directory, copy the
files into it, and securely delete the original directory. For example:

     mkdir "MNT/dir.new"
     fscrypt encrypt "MNT/dir.new"
     cp -a -T "MNT/dir" "MNT/dir.new"
     find "MNT/dir" -type f -print0 | xargs -0 shred -n1 --remove=unlink
     rm -rf "MNT/dir"
     mv "MNT/dir.new" "MNT/dir"

Caution: due to the nature of modern storage devices and filesystems, the
original data may still be recoverable from disk. It's much better to encrypt
your files from the start.
