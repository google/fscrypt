# Try to encrypt as root
[ERROR] fscrypt encrypt: user must be specified when run as root

When running this command as root, you usually still want to provision/remove
keys for a normal user's keyring and use a normal user's login passphrase as a
protector (so the corresponding files will be accessible for that user). This
can be done with --user=USERNAME. To use the root user's keyring or passphrase,
use --user=root.

# Try to use --user=root as user
[ERROR] fscrypt encrypt: could not access user keyring for "root": setting uids:
                         operation not permitted

You can only use --user=USERNAME to access the user keyring of another user if
you are running as root.

# Try to encrypt without user keyring in session keyring
[ERROR] fscrypt encrypt: user keyring for "fscrypt-test-user" is not linked into
                         the session keyring

This is usually the result of a bad PAM configuration. Either correct the
problem in your PAM stack, enable pam_keyinit.so, or run "keyctl link @u @s".

it should be run with --drop-caches=false (this may leave encrypted files and
directories in an accessible state).
