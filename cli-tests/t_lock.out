# Try to lock directory while files busy
[ERROR] fscrypt lock: Directory was incompletely locked because some files are
                      still open. These files remain accessible.

Try killing any processes using files in the directory, for example using:

     find "MNT/dir" -print0 | xargs -0 fuser -k

Then re-run:

     fscrypt lock "MNT/dir"

                      locked because other user(s) have unlocked it.

If you want to force the directory to be locked, use:

     sudo fscrypt lock --all-users "MNT/dir"

[ERROR] fscrypt status: cannot operate on locked regular file
                        "MNT/file"

It is not possible to operate directly on a locked regular file, since the
kernel does not support this. Specify the parent directory instead. (For loose
files, any directory with the file's policy works.)
