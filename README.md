`fscrypt` is a high-level tool for the management of [Linux native filesystem
encryption](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fscrypt.html).
`fscrypt` manages metadata, key generation, key wrapping, PAM integration, and
provides a uniform interface for creating and modifying encrypted directories.
For a small low-level tool that directly sets policies, see
[`fscryptctl`](https://github.com/google/fscryptctl).

To use `fscrypt`, you must have a filesystem that supports the Linux native
filesystem encryption API (which is also sometimes called "fscrypt"; this
documentation calls it "Linux native filesystem encryption" to avoid confusion).
Only certain filesystems, such as [ext4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4) and
[f2fs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F2FS), support this API.  For a full list
of supported filesystems and how to enable encryption support on each one, see
[Runtime dependencies](#runtime-dependencies).

## Alternatives to consider

Operating-system level storage encryption solutions work at either the
filesystem or block device level.  [Linux native filesystem
encryption](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fscrypt.html)
(the solution configured by `fscrypt`) is filesystem-level; it encrypts
individual directories.  Only file contents and filenames are encrypted;
non-filename metadata, such as timestamps, the sizes and number of files, and
extended attributes, is **not** encrypted.  Users choose which directories will
be encrypted, and with what keys.

Before using `fscrypt`, you should consider other solutions:

* [**dm-crypt/LUKS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dm-crypt) is block device
  level encryption: it encrypts an entire block device (and hence an entire
  filesystem) with one key.  Unlocking this key will unlock the entire block
  device.  dm-crypt/LUKS is usually configured using
  [cryptsetup](https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/-/wikis/home).

* [**eCryptfs**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECryptfs) is an alternative
  filesystem-level encryption solution.  It is a stacked filesystem, which means
  it sits on top of a real filesystem, rather than being directly integrated
  into the real filesystem.  Stacked filesystems have a couple advantages (such
  as working on almost any real filesystem), but also some significant
  disadvantages.  eCryptfs is usually configured using
  [ecryptfs-utils](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/ecryptfs-utils).

* The [**ZFS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS) filesystem supports
  encryption in its own way (not compatible with `fscrypt`).  ZFS encryption has
  some advantages; however, ZFS isn't part of the upstream Linux kernel and is
  less common than other filesystems, so this solution usually isn't an option.

Which solution to use?  Here are our recommendations:

* eCryptfs shouldn't be used, if at all possible.  eCryptfs's use of filesystem
  stacking causes a number of issues, and eCryptfs is no longer actively
  maintained.  The original author of eCryptfs recommends using Linux native
  filesystem encryption instead.  The largest users of eCryptfs (Ubuntu and
  Chrome OS) have switched to dm-crypt or Linux native filesystem encryption.

* If you need fine-grained control of encryption within a filesystem, then use
  `fscrypt`, or `fscrypt` together with dm-crypt/LUKS.  If you don't need this,
  then use dm-crypt/LUKS.

  To understand this recommendation: consider that the main advantage of
  `fscrypt` is to allow different files on the same filesystem to be encrypted
  by different keys, and thus be unlockable, lockable, and securely deletable
  independently from each other.  Therefore, `fscrypt` is useful in cases such
  as:

    * Multi-user systems, since each user's files can be encrypted with their
      own key that is unlocked by their own passphrase.

    * Single-user systems where it's not possible for all files to have the
      strongest level of protection.  For example, it might be necessary for the
      system to boot up without user interaction.  Any files that are needed to
      do so can only be encrypted by a hardware-protected (e.g. TPM-bound) key
      at best.  If the user's personal files are located on the same filesystem,
      then with dm-crypt/LUKS the user's personal files would be limited to this
      weak level of protection.  With `fscrypt`, the user's personal files could
      be fully protected using the user's passphrase.

  `fscrypt` isn't very useful in the following cases:

    * Single-user systems where the user is willing to enter a strong passphrase
      at boot time to unlock the entire filesystem.  In this case, the main
      advantage of `fscrypt` would go unused, so dm-crypt/LUKS would be better
      as it would provide better security (due to ensuring that all files and
      all filesystem metadata are encrypted).

    * Any case where it is feasible to create a separate filesystem for every
      encryption key you want to use.

  Note: dm-crypt/LUKS and `fscrypt` aren't mutually exclusive; they can be used
  together when the performance hit of double encryption is tolerable.  It only
  makes sense to do this when the keys for each encryption layer are protected
  in different ways, such that each layer serves a different purpose.  A
  reasonable set-up would be to encrypt the whole filesystem with dm-crypt/LUKS
  using a TPM-bound key that is automatically unlocked at boot time, and also
  encrypt users' home directories with `fscrypt` using their login passphrases.

## Threat model

Like other storage encryption solutions (including dm-crypt/LUKS and eCryptfs),
Linux native filesystem encryption is primarily intended to protect the
confidentiality of data from a single point-in-time permanent offline compromise
of the disk.  For a detailed description of the threat model, see the [kernel
documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fscrypt.html#threat-model).

It's worth emphasizing that none of these encryption solutions protect unlocked
encrypted files from other users on the same system (that's the job of OS-level
access control, such as UNIX file permissions), or from the cloud provider you
may be running a virtual machine on.  By themselves, they also do not protect
from "evil maid" attacks, i.e. non-permanent offline compromises of the disk.

## Features

`fscrypt` is intended to improve upon the work in
[e4crypt](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/e4crypt.8.html) by providing a
more managed environment and handling more functionality in the background.
`fscrypt` has a [design document](https://goo.gl/55cCrI) specifying its full
architecture.  See also the [kernel documentation for Linux native filesystem
encryption](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fscrypt.html).

Briefly, `fscrypt` deals with protectors and policies. Protectors represent some
secret or information used to protect the confidentiality of your data. The
three currently supported protector types are:

1. Your login passphrase, through [PAM](http://www.linux-pam.org/Linux-PAM-html).
   The included PAM module (`pam_fscrypt.so`) can automatically unlock
   directories protected by your login passphrase when you log in, and lock them
   when you log out.  __IMPORTANT:__ before using a login protector, follow
   [Setting up for login protectors](#setting-up-for-login-protectors).

2. A custom passphrase.  This passphrase is hashed with
   [Argon2id](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2), by default calibrated to
   use all CPUs and take about 1 second.

3. A raw key file.  See [Using a raw key protector](#using-a-raw-key-protector).

These protectors are mutable, so the information can change without needing to
update any of your encrypted directories.

Policies represent the actual key passed to the kernel. This "policy key" is
immutable and policies are (usually) applied to a single directory. Protectors
then protect policies, so that having one of the protectors for a policy is
enough to get the policy key and access the data. Which protectors protect a
policy can also be changed. This allows a user to change how a directory is
protected without needing to reencrypt the directory's contents.

Concretely, `fscrypt` contains the following functionality:
*   `fscrypt setup` - Creates `/etc/fscrypt.conf` and the `/.fscrypt` directory
    * This is the only functionality which always requires root privileges
*   `fscrypt setup MOUNTPOINT` - Gets a filesystem ready for use with fscrypt
*   `fscrypt encrypt DIRECTORY` - Encrypts an empty directory
*   `fscrypt unlock DIRECTORY` - Unlocks an encrypted directory
*   `fscrypt lock DIRECTORY` - Locks an encrypted directory
*   `fscrypt purge MOUNTPOINT` - Locks all encrypted directories on a filesystem
*   `fscrypt status [PATH]` - Gets detailed info about filesystems or paths
*   `fscrypt metadata` - Manages policies or protectors directly

See the example usage section below or run `fscrypt COMMAND --help` for more
information about each of the commands.

## Building and installing

`fscrypt` has a minimal set of build dependencies:
*   [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.16 or higher. Older versions may work
    but they are not tested or supported.
*   A C compiler (`gcc` or `clang`)
*   `make`
*   Headers for [`libpam`](http://www.linux-pam.org/).
    Install them with the appropriate package manager:
    - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libpam0g-dev`
    - Red Hat: `sudo yum install pam-devel`
    - Arch: [`pam`](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/pam/)
      package (usually installed by default)

Once all the dependencies are installed, you can get the repository by running:
```shell
go get -d github.com/google/fscrypt/...
```
Running `make` in `$GOPATH/src/github.com/google/fscrypt` builds the binary
(`fscrypt`) and PAM module (`pam_fscrypt.so`) in the `bin/` directory.

Running `sudo make install` installs `fscrypt` into `/usr/local/bin`,
`pam_fscrypt.so` into `/usr/local/lib/security`, and `pam_fscrypt/config` into
`/usr/local/share/pam-configs`.

On Debian (and Debian derivatives such as Ubuntu), use `sudo make install
PREFIX=/usr` to install into `/usr` instead of the default of `/usr/local`.
Ordinarily you shouldn't manually install software into `/usr`, since `/usr` is
reserved for Debian's own packages.  However, Debian's PAM configuration
framework only recognizes configuration files in `/usr`, not in `/usr/local`.
Therefore, the PAM module will only work if you install into `/usr`.  Note: if
you later decide to switch to using the Debian package `libpam-fscrypt`, you'll
have to first manually run `sudo make uninstall PREFIX=/usr`.

It is also possible to use `make install-bin` to only install the `fscrypt`
binary, or `make install-pam` to only install the PAM files.

Alternatively, if you only want to install the `fscrypt` binary to
`$GOPATH/bin`, simply run:
```shell
go get github.com/google/fscrypt/cmd/fscrypt
```

See the `Makefile` for instructions on how to further customize the build.

## Runtime dependencies

To run, `fscrypt` needs the following libraries:
*   `libpam.so` (almost certainly already on your system)

In addition, `fscrypt` requires a filesystem that supports the Linux native
filesystem encryption API.  Currently, the filesystems that support this are:

* ext4, with upstream kernel v4.1 or later.  The kernel configuration must
  contain `CONFIG_FS_ENCRYPTION=y` (for kernels v5.1+) or
  `CONFIG_EXT4_ENCRYPTION=y` or `=m` (for older kernels).  The filesystem must
  also have the `encrypt` feature flag enabled; to enable this flag, see
  [here](#getting-encryption-not-enabled-on-an-ext4-filesystem).

* f2fs, with upstream kernel v4.2 or later.  The kernel configuration must
  contain `CONFIG_FS_ENCRYPTION=y` (for kernels v5.1+) or
  `CONFIG_F2FS_FS_ENCRYPTION=y` (for older kernels).  The filesystem must also
  have the `encrypt` feature flag enabled; this flag can be enabled at format
  time by `mkfs.f2fs -O encrypt` or later by `fsck.f2fs -O encrypt`.

* UBIFS, with upstream kernel v4.10 or later.  The kernel configuration must
  contain `CONFIG_FS_ENCRYPTION=y` (for kernels v5.1+) or
  `CONFIG_UBIFS_FS_ENCRYPTION=y` (for older kernels).

* [Lustre](https://www.lustre.org/), with Lustre v2.14.0 or later.  For details,
  see the Lustre documentation.  Please note that Lustre is not part of the
  upstream Linux kernel, and its encryption implementation has not been reviewed
  by the authors of `fscrypt`.  Questions/issues about Lustre encryption should
  be directed to the Lustre developers.  Lustre version 2.14 does not encrypt
  filenames, even though it claims to, so v2.15.0 or later should be used.

To check whether the needed option is enabled in your kernel, run:
```shell
zgrep -h ENCRYPTION /proc/config.gz /boot/config-$(uname -r) | sort | uniq
```

It is also recommended to use Linux kernel v5.4 or later, since this
allows the use of v2 encryption policies.  v2 policies have several
security and usability improvements over v1 policies.

Be careful when using ext4 encryption on removable media, since ext4 filesystems
with the `encrypt` feature cannot be mounted on systems with kernel versions
older than the minimums listed above -- even to access unencrypted files!

If you configure `fscrypt` to use non-default features, other kernel
prerequisites may be needed too.  See [Configuration
file](#configuration-file).

## Configuration file

Running `sudo fscrypt setup` will create the configuration file
`/etc/fscrypt.conf` if it doesn't already exist.  It's a JSON file
that looks like the following:

```
{
	"source": "custom_passphrase",
	"hash_costs": {
		"time": "52",
		"memory": "131072",
		"parallelism": "32"
	},
	"options": {
		"padding": "32",
		"contents": "AES_256_XTS",
		"filenames": "AES_256_CTS",
		"policy_version": "2"
	},
	"use_fs_keyring_for_v1_policies": false,
	"allow_cross_user_metadata": false
}
```

The fields are:

* "source" is the default source for new protectors.  The choices are
  "pam\_passphrase", "custom\_passphrase", and "raw\_key".

* "hash\_costs" describes how difficult the passphrase hashing is.
  By default, `fscrypt setup` calibrates the hashing to use all CPUs
  and take about 1 second.  The `--time` option to `fscrypt setup` can
  be used to customize this time when creating the configuration file.

* "options" are the encryption options to use for new encrypted
  directories:

    * "padding" is the number of bytes by which filenames are padded
      before being encrypted.  The choices are "32", "16", "8", and
      "4".  "32" is recommended.

    * "contents" is the algorithm used to encrypt file contents.  The
      choices are "AES_256_XTS", "AES_128_CBC", and "Adiantum".
      Normally, "AES_256_XTS" is recommended.

    * "filenames" is the algorithm used to encrypt file names.  The
      choices are "AES_256_CTS", "AES_128_CTS", "Adiantum", and
      "AES_256_HCTR2".  Normally, "AES_256_CTS" is recommended.

      To use algorithms other than "AES_256_XTS" for contents and
      "AES_256_CTS" for filenames, the needed algorithm(s) may need to
      be enabled in the Linux kernel's cryptography API.  For example,
      to use Adiantum, `CONFIG_CRYPTO_ADIANTUM` must be set.  Also,
      not all combinations of algorithms are allowed; for example,
      "Adiantum" for contents can only be paired with "Adiantum" for
      filenames.  See the [kernel
      documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fscrypt.html#encryption-modes-and-usage)
      for more details about the supported algorithms.

    * "policy\_version" is the version of encryption policy to use.
      The choices are "1" and "2".  If unset, "1" is assumed.
      Directories created with policy version "2" are only usable on
      kernel v5.4 or later, but are preferable to version "1" if you
      don't mind this restriction.

* "use\_fs\_keyring\_for\_v1\_policies" specifies whether to add keys for v1
  encryption policies to the filesystem keyrings, rather than to user keyrings.
  This can solve [issues with processes being unable to access unlocked
  encrypted files](#some-processes-cant-access-unlocked-encrypted-files).
  However, it requires kernel v5.4 or later, and it makes unlocking and locking
  encrypted directories require root.  (The PAM module will still work.)

  The purpose of this setting is to allow people to take advantage of some of
  the improvements in Linux v5.4 on encrypted directories that are also
  compatible with older kernels.  If you don't need compatibility with older
  kernels, it's better to not use this setting and instead (re-)create your
  encrypted directories with `"policy_version": "2"`.

* "allow\_cross\_user\_metadata" specifies whether `fscrypt` will allow
  protectors and policies from other non-root users to be read, e.g. to be
  offered as options by `fscrypt encrypt`.  The default value is `false`, since
  other users might be untrusted and could create malicious files.  This can be
  set to `true` to restore the old behavior on systems where `fscrypt` metadata
  needs to be shared between multiple users.  Note that this option is
  independent from the permissions on the metadata files themselves, which are
  set to 0600 by default; users who wish to share their metadata files with
  other users would also need to explicitly change their mode to 0644.

## Setting up `fscrypt` on a filesystem

`fscrypt` needs some directories to exist on the filesystem on which encryption
will be used:

* `MOUNTPOINT/.fscrypt/policies`
* `MOUNTPOINT/.fscrypt/protectors`

(If login protectors are used, these must also exist on the root filesystem.)

To create these directories, run `fscrypt setup MOUNTPOINT`.  If MOUNTPOINT is
owned by root, as is usually the case, then this command will require root.

There will be one decision you'll need to make: whether non-root users will be
allowed to create `fscrypt` metadata (policies and protectors).

If you say `y`, then these directories will be made world-writable, with the
sticky bit set so that users can't delete each other's files -- just like
`/tmp`.  If you say `N`, then these directories will be writable only by root.

Saying `y` maximizes the usability of `fscrypt`, and on most systems it's fine
to say `y`.  However, on some systems this may be inappropriate, as it will
allow malicious users to fill the entire filesystem unless filesystem quotas
have been configured -- similar to problems that have historically existed with
other world-writable directories, e.g. `/tmp`.  If you are concerned about this,
say `N`.  If you say `N`, then you'll only be able to run `fscrypt` as root to
set up encryption on users' behalf, unless you manually set custom permissions
on the metadata directories to grant write access to specific users or groups.

If you chose the wrong mode at `fscrypt setup` time, you can change the
directory permissions at any time.  To enable single-user writable mode, run:

    sudo chmod 0755 MOUNTPOINT/.fscrypt/*

To enable world-writable mode, run:

    sudo chmod 1777 MOUNTPOINT/.fscrypt/*

## Setting up for login protectors

If you want any encrypted directories to be protected by your login passphrase,
you'll need to:

1. Secure your login passphrase (optional, but strongly recommended)
2. Enable the PAM module (`pam_fscrypt.so`)

If you installed `fscrypt` from source rather than from your distro's package
manager, you may also need to allow `fscrypt` to check your login passphrase.

### Securing your login passphrase

Although `fscrypt` uses a strong passphrase hash algorithm, the security of
login protectors is also limited by the strength of your system's passphrase
hashing in `/etc/shadow`.  On most Linux distributions, `/etc/shadow` by default
uses SHA-512 with 5000 rounds, which is much weaker than what `fscrypt` uses.

To mitigate this, you should use a strong login passphrase.

If using a strong login passphrase is annoying because it needs to be entered
frequently to run `sudo`, consider increasing the `sudo` timeout.  That can be
done by adding the following to `/etc/sudoers`:
```
Defaults timestamp_timeout=60
```

You should also increase the number of rounds that your system's passphrase
hashing uses (though this doesn't increase security as much as choosing a strong
passphrase).  To do this, find the line in `/etc/pam.d/passwd` that looks like:
```
password	required	pam_unix.so sha512 shadow nullok
```

Append `rounds=1000000` (or another number of your choice; the goal is to make
the passphrase hashing take about 1 second, similar to `fscrypt`'s default):
```
password	required	pam_unix.so sha512 shadow nullok rounds=1000000
```

Then, change your login passphrase to a new, strong passphrase:
```
passwd
```

If you'd like to keep the same login passphrase (not recommended, as the old
passphrase hash may still be recoverable from disk), then instead run
`sudo passwd $USER` and enter your existing passphrase.  This re-hashes your
existing passphrase with the new `rounds`.

### Enabling the PAM module

To enable the PAM module `pam_fscrypt.so`, follow the directions for your Linux
distro below.  Enabling the PAM module is needed for login passphrase-protected
directories to be automatically unlocked when you log in (and be automatically
locked when you log out), and for login passphrase-protected directories to
remain accessible when you change your login passphrase.

#### Enabling the PAM module on Debian or Ubuntu

The official `libpam-fscrypt` package for Debian (and Debian derivatives such as
Ubuntu) will install a configuration file for [Debian's PAM configuration
framework](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PAMConfigFrameworkSpec) to
`/usr/share/pam-configs/fscrypt`.  This file contains reasonable defaults for
the PAM module.  To automatically apply these defaults, run
`sudo pam-auth-update` and follow the on-screen instructions.

This file also gets installed if you build and install `fscrypt` from source,
but it is only installed to the correct location if you use `make install
PREFIX=/usr` to install into `/usr` instead of the default of `/usr/local`.

#### Enabling the PAM module on Arch Linux

On Arch Linux, follow the recommendations at the [Arch Linux
Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fscrypt#Auto-unlocking_directories).

We recommend using the Arch Linux package, either `fscrypt` (official) or
`fscrypt-git` (AUR).  If you instead install `fscrypt` manually using `sudo make
install`, then in addition to the steps on the Wiki you'll also need to [create
`/etc/pam.d/fscrypt`](#allowing-fscrypt-to-check-your-login-passphrase).

#### Enabling the PAM module on other Linux distros

On all other Linux distros, follow the general guidance below to edit
your PAM configuration files.

The `fscrypt` PAM module implements the Auth, Session, and Password
[types](http://www.linux-pam.org/Linux-PAM-html/sag-configuration-file.html).

The Password functionality of `pam_fscrypt.so` is used to automatically rewrap
a user's login protector when their unix passphrase changes. An easy way to get
the working is to add the line:
```
password    optional    pam_fscrypt.so
```
after `pam_unix.so` in `/etc/pam.d/common-password` or similar.

The Auth and Session functionality of `pam_fscrypt.so` are used to automatically
unlock directories when logging in as a user, and lock them when logging out.
An easy way to get this working is to add the line:
```
auth        optional    pam_fscrypt.so
```
after `pam_unix.so` in `/etc/pam.d/common-auth` or similar, and to add the
line:
```
session     optional    pam_fscrypt.so
```
after `pam_unix.so` in `/etc/pam.d/common-session` or similar, but before
`pam_systemd.so` or any other module that accesses the user's home directory or
which starts processes that access the user's home directory during their
session.

To make `pam_fscrypt.so` print debugging messages to the system log, add the
`debug` option.  All hook types accept this option.

### Allowing `fscrypt` to check your login passphrase

This step is only needed if you installed `fscrypt` from source code.

Some Linux distros use restrictive settings in `/etc/pam.d/other` that prevent
programs from checking your login passphrase unless a per-program PAM
configuration file grants access.  This prevents `fscrypt` from creating any
login passphrase-protected directories, even without auto-unlocking.  To ensure
that `fscrypt` will work properly (if you didn't install an official `fscrypt`
package from your distro, which should have already handled this), also create a
file `/etc/pam.d/fscrypt` containing:
```
auth        required    pam_unix.so
```

## Backup, restore, and recovery

Encrypted files and directories can't be backed up while they are "locked", i.e.
while they appear in encrypted form.  They can only be backed up while they are
unlocked, in which case they can be backed up like any other files.  Note that
since the encryption is transparent, the files won't be encrypted in the backup
(unless the backup applies its own encryption).

For the same reason (and several others), an encrypted directory can't be
directly "moved" to another filesystem.  However, it is possible to create a new
encrypted directory on the destination filesystem using `fscrypt encrypt`, then
copy the contents of the source directory into it.

For directories protected by a `custom_passphrase` or `raw_key` protector, all
metadata needed to unlock the directory (excluding the actual passphrase or raw
key, of course) is located in the `.fscrypt` directory at the root of the
filesystem that contains the encrypted directory.  For example, if you have an
encrypted directory `/home/$USER/private` that is protected by a custom
passphrase, all `fscrypt` metadata needed to unlock the directory with that
custom passphrase will be located in `/home/.fscrypt` if you are using a
dedicated `/home` filesystem or in `/.fscrypt` if you aren't.  If desired, you
can back up the `fscrypt` metadata by making a copy of this directory, although
this isn't too important since this metadata is located on the same filesystem
as the encrypted directory(s).

`pam_passphrase` (login passphrase) protectors are a bit different as they are
always stored on the root filesystem, in `/.fscrypt`.  This ties them to the
specific system and ensures that each user has only a single login protector.
Therefore, encrypted directories on a non-root filesystem **can't be unlocked
via a login protector if the operating system is reinstalled or if the disk is
connected to another system** -- even if the new system uses the same login
passphrase for the user.

Because of this, `fscrypt encrypt` will automatically generate a recovery
passphrase when creating a login passphrase-protected directory on a non-root
filesystem.  The recovery passphrase is simply a `custom_passphrase` protector
with a randomly generated high-entropy passphrase.  Initially, the recovery
passphrase is stored in a file in the encrypted directory itself; therefore, to
use it you **must** record it in another secure location.  It is strongly
recommended to do this.  Then, if ever needed, you can use `fscrypt unlock` to
unlock the directory with the recovery passphrase (by choosing the recovery
protector instead of the login protector).

If you really want to disable the generation of a recovery passphrase, use the
`--no-recovery` option.  Only do this if you really know what you are doing and
are prepared for potential data loss.

Alternative approaches to supporting recovery of login passphrase-protected
directories include the following:

* Manually adding your own recovery protector, using
  `fscrypt metadata add-protector-to-policy`.

* Backing up and restoring the `/.fscrypt` directory on the root filesystem.
  Note that after restoring the `/.fscrypt` directory, unlocking the login
  protectors will require the passphrases they had at the time the backup was
  made **even if they were changed later**, so make sure to remember these
  passphrase(s) or record them in a secure location.  Also note that if the UUID
  of the root filesystem changed, you will need to manually fix the UUID in any
  `.fscrypt/protectors/*.link` files on other filesystems.

The auto-generated recovery passphrases should be enough for most users, though.

## Encrypting existing files

`fscrypt` isn't designed to encrypt existing files, as this presents significant
technical challenges and usually is impossible to do securely.  Therefore,
`fscrypt encrypt` only works on empty directories.

Of course, it is still possible to create an encrypted directory, copy files
into it, and delete the original files.  The `mv` command will even work, as it
will fall back to a copy and delete ([except on older
kernels](#getting-operation-not-permitted-when-moving-files-into-an-encrypted-directory)).
However, beware that due to the characteristics of filesystems and storage
devices, this may not properly protect the files, as their original contents may
still be forensically recoverable from disk even after being deleted.  It's
**much** better to encrypt files from the very beginning.

There are only a few cases where copying files into an encrypted directory can
really make sense, such as:

* The source files are located on an in-memory filesystem such as `tmpfs`.

* The confidentiality of the source files isn't important, e.g. they are
  system default files and the user hasn't added any personal files yet.

* The source files are protected by a different `fscrypt` policy, the old and
  new policies are protected by only the same protector(s), and the old policy
  uses similar strength encryption.

If one of the above doesn't apply, then it's probably too late to securely
encrypt your existing files.

As a best-effort attempt, you can use the `shred` program to try to erase the
original files.  Here are the recommended commands for "best-effort" encryption
of an existing directory named "dir":

```bash
mkdir dir.new
fscrypt encrypt dir.new
cp -a -T dir dir.new
find dir -type f -print0 | xargs -0 shred -n1 --remove=unlink
rm -rf dir
mv dir.new dir
```

However, beware that `shred` isn't guaranteed to be effective on all storage
devices and filesystems.  For example, if you're using an SSD, "overwrites" of
data typically go to new flash blocks, so they aren't really overwrites.

Note: for reasons similar to the above, changed or removed `fscrypt` protectors
aren't guaranteed to be forensically unrecoverable from disk either.  Thus, the
use of weak or default passphrases should be avoided, even if changed later.

## Example usage

All these examples assume there is an ext4 filesystem which supports
encryption mounted at `/mnt/disk`.  See
[here](#getting-encryption-not-enabled-on-an-ext4-filesystem) for how
to enable encryption support on an ext4 filesystem.

### Protecting a directory with your login passphrase

First, ensure that you have properly [set up your system for login
protectors](#setting-up-for-login-protectors).

Then, you can protect directories with your login passphrase as follows:

### Using a raw key protector

`fscrypt` also supports protectors which use raw key files as the user-provided
secret. These key files must be exactly 32 bytes long and contain the raw binary
data of the key. Obviously, make sure to store the key file securely (and not in
the directory you are encrypting with it). If generating the keys on Linux make
sure you are aware of
[how randomness works](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/random.7.html) and
[some common myths](https://www.2uo.de/myths-about-urandom/).

```bash
# Generate a 256-bit key file
>>>>> head --bytes=32 /dev/urandom > secret.key

# Now create a key file protector without using it on a directory. Note that we
# could also use `fscrypt encrypt --key=secret.key` to achieve the same thing.
>>>>> fscrypt metadata create protector /mnt/disk

>>>>> mkdir /mnt/disk/dir3

### Using multiple protectors for a policy

`fscrypt` supports the idea of protecting a single directory with multiple
protectors. This means having access to any of the protectors is sufficient to
decrypt the directory. This is useful for sharing data or setting up access
control systems.

```bash
# Add an existing protector to the policy for some directory
>>>>> fscrypt status /mnt/disk
ext4 filesystem "/mnt/disk" has 3 protectors and 3 policies

## Troubleshooting

In general, if you are encountering issues with `fscrypt`,
[open an issue](https://github.com/google/fscrypt/issues/new), following the
guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. We will try our best to help.

#### I changed my login passphrase, now all my directories are inaccessible

Usually, the PAM module `pam_fscrypt.so` will automatically detect changes to a
user's login passphrase and update the user's `fscrypt` login protector so that
they retain access their login-passphrase protected directories.  However,
sometimes a user's login passphrase can become desynchronized from their
`fscrypt` login protector.  This can happen if `root` assigns the user a new
passphrase without providing the old one, if the user's login passphrase is
managed by an external system such as LDAP, if the PAM module is not installed,
or if the PAM module is not properly configured.  See [Enabling the PAM
module](#enabling-the-pam-module) for how to configure the PAM module.

To fix a user's login protector, find the corresponding protector ID by running
`fscrypt status "/"`.  Then, change this protector's passphrase by running:
```
fscrypt metadata change-passphrase --protector=/:ID
```

#### Directories using my login passphrase are not automatically unlocking

First, directories won't unlock if your session starts without password
authentication.  The most common case of this is public-key ssh login.  To
trigger a password authentication event, run `su $USER -c exit`.

If your session did start with password authentication, then the following may
be causing the issue:

* The PAM module might not be configured correctly.  Ensure you have correctly
  [configured the PAM module](#enabling-the-pam-module).

* If your login passphrase recently changed, then it might have gotten out of
  sync with your login protector.  To fix this, [manually change your login
  protector's
  passphrase](#i-changed-my-login-passphrase-now-all-my-directories-are-inaccessible)
  to get it back in sync with your actual login passphrase.

* Due to a [bug in sshd](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2548),
  encrypted directories won't auto-unlock when logging in with ssh using the
  `ChallengeResponseAuthentication` ssh authentication method, which is also
  called `KbdInteractiveAuthentication`.  This ssh authentication method
  implements password authentication by default, so it might appear similar to
  `PasswordAuthentication`.  However, only `PasswordAuthentication` works with
  `fscrypt`.  To avoid this issue, make sure that your `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
  file contains `PasswordAuthentication yes`, `UsePAM yes`, and either
  `ChallengeResponseAuthentication no` or `KbdInteractiveAuthentication no`.

#### Getting "encryption not enabled" on an ext4 filesystem

This is usually caused by your ext4 filesystem not having the `encrypt` feature
flag enabled.  The `encrypt` feature flag allows the filesystem to contain
encrypted files.  (It doesn't actually encrypt anything by itself.)

Before enabling `encrypt` on your ext4 filesystem, first ensure that all of the
following are true for you:

* You only need to use your filesystem on kernels v4.1 and later.

  (Kernels v4.0 and earlier can't mount ext4 filesystems that have the `encrypt`
  feature flag.)

* Either you only need to use your filesystem on kernels v5.5 and later, or your
  kernel page size (run `getconf PAGE_SIZE`) and filesystem block size (run
  `tune2fs -l /dev/device | grep 'Block size'`) are the same.

  (Both values will almost always be 4096, but they may differ if your
  filesystem is very small, if your system uses the PowerPC CPU architecture, or
  if you overrode the default block size when you created the filesystem.  Only
  kernels v5.5 and later support ext4 encryption in such cases.)

* Either you aren't using GRUB to boot directly off the filesystem in question,
  or you are using GRUB 2.04 or later.

  (Old versions of GRUB can't boot from ext4 filesystems that have `encrypt`
  enabled.  If, like most people, you have a separate `/boot` partition, you are
  fine.  You are also fine if you are using the GRUB Debian package `2.02-2` or
  later [*not* `2.02_beta*`], including the version in Ubuntu 18.04 and later,
  since the patch to support `encrypt` was backported.)

After verifying all of the above, enable `encrypt` by running:
```
tune2fs -O encrypt /dev/device
```

If you need to undo this, first delete all encrypted files and directories on
the filesystem.  Then, run:
```
fsck -fn /dev/device
debugfs -w -R "feature -encrypt" /dev/device
fsck -fn /dev/device
``` 

If you've enabled `encrypt` but you still get the "encryption not enabled"
error, then the problem is that ext4 encryption isn't enabled in your kernel
config.  See [Runtime dependencies](#runtime-dependencies) for how to enable it.

#### Getting "user keyring not linked into session keyring"

Some older versions of Ubuntu didn't link the user keyring into the session
keyring, which caused problems with `fscrypt`.

To avoid this issue, upgrade to Ubuntu 20.04 or later.

#### Getting "Operation not permitted" when moving files into an encrypted directory

Originally, filesystems didn't return the correct error code when attempting to
rename unencrypted files (or files with a different encryption policy) into an
encrypted directory.  Specifically, they returned `EPERM` instead of `EXDEV`,
which caused `mv` to fail rather than fall back to a copy as expected.

This bug was fixed in version 5.1 of the mainline Linux kernel, as well as in
versions 4.4 and later of the LTS (Long Term Support) branches of the Linux
kernel; specifically v4.19.155, 4.14.204, v4.9.242, and v4.4.242.

If the kernel can't be upgraded, this bug can be worked around by explicitly
copying the files instead, e.g. with `cp`.

__IMPORTANT:__ Encrypting existing files can be insecure.  Before doing so, read
[Encrypting existing files](#encrypting-existing-files).

#### Getting "Package not installed" when trying to use an encrypted directory

Trying to create or open an encrypted file will fail with `ENOPKG` ("Package not
installed") when the kernel doesn't support one or more of the cryptographic
algorithms used by the file or its directory.  Note that `fscrypt encrypt` and
`fscrypt unlock` will still succeed; it's only using the directory afterwards
that will fail.

The kernel will always support the algorithms that `fscrypt` uses by default.
However, if you changed the contents and/or filenames encryption algorithms in
[`/etc/fscrypt.conf`](#configuration-file), then you may run into this issue.
To fix it, enable the needed `CONFIG_CRYPTO_*` options in your Linux kernel
configuration.  See the [kernel
documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fscrypt.html#encryption-modes-and-usage)
for details about which option(s) are required for each encryption mode.

#### Some processes can't access unlocked encrypted files

This issue is caused by a limitation in the original design of Linux native
filesystem encryption which made it difficult to ensure that all processes can
access unlocked encrypted files.  This issue can manifest in many ways, such as:

* SSH to a user with an encrypted home directory not working, even when that
  directory is already unlocked

* Docker containers being unable to access encrypted files that were unlocked
  from outside the container

* NetworkManager being unable to access certificates stored in the user's
  already-unlocked encrypted home directory

* Other system services being unable to access already-unlocked encrypted files

* `sudo` sessions being unable to access already-unlocked encrypted files

* A user being unable to access encrypted files that were unlocked by root

If an OS-level error is shown, it is `ENOKEY` ("Required key not available").

To fix this issue, first run `fscrypt status $dir`, where `$dir` is your
encrypted directory.  If the output contains `policy_version:2`, then your issue
is something else, so stop reading now.  If the output contains
`policy_version:1` or doesn't contain any mention of `policy_version`, then
you'll need to upgrade your directory(s) to policy version 2.  To do this:

1. Upgrade to Linux kernel v5.4 or later.

2. Upgrade to `fscrypt` v0.2.7 or later.

3. Run `sudo fscrypt setup --force`.

4. Re-encrypt your encrypted directory(s).  Since files cannot be (re-)encrypted
   in-place, this requires replacing them with new directories.  For example:
   ```
     fscrypt unlock dir  # if not already unlocked
     mkdir dir.new
     fscrypt encrypt dir.new
     cp -a -T dir dir.new
     find dir -type f -print0 | xargs -0 shred -n1 --remove=unlink
     rm -rf dir
     mv dir.new dir
   ```

   You don't need to create a new protector.  I.e., when `fscrypt encrypt` asks
   for a protector, just choose the one you were using before.

5. `fscrypt status` on your directory(s) should now show `policy_version:2`,
   and the issue should be gone.

Note that once your directories are using policy version 2, they will only be
usable with Linux kernel v5.4 and later and `fscrypt` v0.2.6 and later.  So be
careful not to downgrade your software past those versions.

This issue can also be fixed by setting `"use_fs_keyring_for_v1_policies": true`
in `/etc/fscrypt.conf`, as described in [Configuration
file](#configuration-file).  This avoids needing to upgrade directories to
policy version 2.  However, this has some limitations, and the same kernel and
`fscrypt` prerequisites still apply for this option to take effect.  It is
recommended to upgrade your directories to policy version 2 instead.

#### Users can access other users' unlocked encrypted files

This is working as intended.  When an encrypted directory is unlocked (or
locked), it is unlocked (or locked) for all users.  Encryption is not access
control; the Linux kernel already has many access control mechanisms, such as
the standard UNIX file permissions, that can be used to control access to files.

Setting the mode of your encrypted directory to `0700` will prevent users other
than the directory's owner and `root` from accessing it while it is unlocked.
In `fscrypt` v0.2.5 and later, `fscrypt encrypt` sets this mode automatically.

Having the locked/unlocked status of directories be global instead of per-user
may seem unintuitive, but it is actually the only logical way.  The encryption
is done by the filesystem, so in reality the filesystem either has the key or it
doesn't.  And once it has the key, any additional checks of whether particular
users "have" the key would be OS-level access control checks (not cryptography)
that are redundant with existing OS-level access control mechanisms.

Similarly, any attempt of the filesystem encryption feature to prevent `root`
from accessing unlocked encrypted files would be pointless.  On Linux systems,
`root` is usually all-powerful and can always get access to files in ways that
cannot be prevented, e.g. `setuid()` and `ptrace()`.  The only reliable way to
limit what `root` can do is via a mandatory access control system, e.g. SELinux.

The original design of Linux native filesystem encryption actually did put the
keys into per-user keyrings.  However, this caused a [massive number of
problems](#some-processes-cant-access-unlocked-encrypted-files), as it's
actually very common that encrypted files need to be accessed by processes
running under different user IDs -- even if it may not be immediately apparent.

#### Getting "Required key not available" when backing up locked encrypted files

Encrypted files can't be backed up while locked; you need to unlock them first.
For details, see [Backup, restore, and recovery](#backup-restore-and-recovery).

#### The reported size of encrypted symlinks is wrong

Originally, filesystems didn't conform to POSIX when reporting the size of
encrypted symlinks, as they gave the size of the ciphertext symlink target
rather than the size of the plaintext target.  This would make the reported size
of symlinks appear to be slightly too large when queried using ``lstat()`` or
similar system calls.  Most programs don't care about this, but in rare cases
programs can depend on the filesystem reporting symlink sizes correctly.

This bug was fixed in version 5.15 of the mainline Linux kernel, as well as in
versions 4.19 and later of the LTS (Long Term Support) branches of the Linux
kernel; specifically v5.10.63, v5.4.145, and v4.19.207.

If the kernel can't be upgraded, the only workaround for this bug is to update
any affected programs to not depend on symlink sizes being reported correctly.
